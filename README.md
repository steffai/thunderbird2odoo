# Odoo Email Importer

<img src="thunderbird2odoo.svg" alt="Odoo Email Importer logo" width="200" height="200">

This Thunderbird add-on imports emails into the ERP software [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com) (version 19+) and shows their Odoo status inline in the message reader.

## Requirements

* Odoo >= 19 (the [External JSON-2 API](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/19.0/developer/reference/external_api.html) was introduced in Odoo 19)
* Optional:
  * [mail_manual_routing](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/19.0/mail_manual_routing) to handle new and unrelated emails that are otherwise not visible in Odoo. For details, see [faotools mail_manual_routing](https://faotools.com/apps/19.0/lost-messages-routing-19-0-mail-manual-routing-1037).
    * Without this extension, emails imported as *Generic* may not be visible.

## Setup

* Odoo:
  * Create an API key: *User → My Preferences → Security → API Keys → Add API key* (see [Odoo documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/19.0/developer/reference/external_api.html#configuration))
* Thunderbird:
  * Install the add-on [Odoo Email Importer](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/odoo-email-importer/)
  * Open the add-on's **Options** page:
    * Set **Odoo URL** to your Odoo server.
    * Set **API Key**.
    * Set **Database** if required (normally not).
    * ![Odoo Email Importer: options window](images/OdooEmailImporter-configure.png)
  * Click *Test connection* — you will be prompted to grant host permission. If successful, click *Save*.

## Usage

### Context Menu

Right-click one or more emails in the message list and select **Odoo Email Importer**:

| Menu item   | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| **Import this email** | Checks Odoo; if not found, checks the parent thread (In-Reply-To / References). Offers to import as *Opportunity (CRM Lead)* or *Generic*. |
| **Verify** | Checks selected emails against Odoo and caches the result. Shows count label (e.g. *Verify 3 messages*). |
| **Sync from Odoo** | Bulk-fetches message IDs from Odoo (within max-age window) into the local cache. |

### Status Bar

When viewing an email, a colored status bar appears at the top of the message pane:

- **Green ●** — email found in Odoo (URL shown, click to open)
- **Amber ●** — email not found, but a parent/reply predecessor was found in Odoo
- **Red ✕** — email and predecessors not found in Odoo

Buttons in the bar:
- **Verify** — re-check this email against Odoo
- **Add** — import the email into Odoo (shown for *not found* / *parent found* only)

Results are cached per message and persist across restarts.

### Options Page

The options page has two sections:

**Odoo Connection** — URL, API key, database, test connection, save.

**Odoo Sync** — Settings for bulk sync:
- **Max age (days)** — how far back to look. 0 = unlimited.
- **Sync limit** — maximum messages to fetch. 0 = unlimited.
- **Count** — preview how many messages Odoo will return.
- **Sync** — incremental sync from Odoo.
- **Clear Cache** — delete all cached statuses.
- Displays cache entry count and last sync time (auto-refreshes).
