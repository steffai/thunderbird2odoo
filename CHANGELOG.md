# Changelog

## 0.6.2

### Changes

- **Options page redesigned**: added logo, tagline, usage summary, and data-privacy notice in a sidebar layout.
- **Config caching**: config is now cached in memory after first read and invalidated on `storage.onChanged`, avoiding repeated `storage.local` IPC calls.
- **Manifest description**: updated to better describe the add-on.

### Fixes

- **Verify not updating cache**: fixed a bug where the verify action did not always refresh the local cache entry for the verified message.

## 0.6.1

### Changes

- **Refactored URL handling**: replaced modelUrl/messageUrl with baseUrl+slug pattern, renamed combineUrl→normalizeUrl, added normalizeUrl unit tests.
- **Status bar styling**: badges now use system colors (ButtonFace/ButtonBorder/ButtonText) and system fonts (caption/small-caption/status-bar) for dark mode compatibility.
- **Removed dead code**: makeIconLink and buildOdooUrl removed.
- **CI consolidated**: single CI workflow runs lint, builds XPI, and creates a release on v* tag push (via softprops/action-gh-release).
- **Fixed parentMessageSlug fallback**: getUrl now considers parentMessageSlug.
- **Fixed numeric ID handling**: normalizeUrl coerces parts to String() for numeric Odoo IDs.

### Fixes

- **AMO review: sync message listener**: `runtime.onMessage` listener is no longer `async` to avoid interfering with other listeners (async listeners always return a Promise, which Thunderbird warns about).
- **Message sync domain filter**: `buildMailDomain` now uses a complex domain that excludes internal messages and non-Discussion notifications (`message_id != false AND is_internal = false AND (message_type != "notification" OR subtype_id = Discussions)`).
- **Discussion subtype lookup**: subtype ID is now fetched from Odoo via `mail.message.subtype/search_read` instead of being hardcoded to `1`, with session-level caching.
- **Mail search**: `findMails` searches only bracketed `[<id>]` format (not `[id, <id>]`), matching Odoo's stored format.

## 0.6.0

### Features

- **Email status bar**: a colored status bar now appears in the message reader when viewing an email that has been checked against Odoo (via the right-click menu). Shows whether the email (or its predecessor) was found in Odoo, with buttons to open, verify, or add the email. Status is cached per email and persists across restarts.
- **Sync from Odoo**: bulk-fetches message IDs from Odoo (within a configurable max-age window) into the local cache. Supports incremental sync (since last sync) and a configurable limit.
- **Verify multiple messages**: select multiple emails and verify them in batch; the menu label reflects the count (e.g. _Verify 3 messages_).
- **Count button**: preview how many messages Odoo will return for the current max-age setting before syncing.
- **Clear Odoo Cache**: button in the options page to invalidate all cached statuses.
- **Options sync section**: max age, sync limit, cache entry count, last sync time (auto-refreshes via `storage.onChanged`).

### Changes

- **Renamed to Odoo Email Connector**: the add-on name now better reflects its broader scope — import, verify, sync, and inline status display.
- **Internal**: refactored `handleOdooImporter` into reusable `importMessageById` and `verifyMessageById` functions.
- **Clipboard copy**: moved entirely to background script (display scripts cannot access `navigator.clipboard`; requires `clipboardWrite` permission).
- **`search_count` endpoint**: used for estimated message counts before sync.
- **Odoo datetime handling**: ISO strings stripped of trailing `Z` to avoid Odoo parse errors.
- **`setup()` menu fix**: `menuIds` set is never cleared (was cleared on every `setup()` call without being repopulated, breaking the `onShown` listener).
- **parent cache lookup**: display script falls back to predecessor cache entries when the current message is not cached, reducing noise for new messages in known threads.

## 0.5.1

### Fixes

- **AMO review warnings**: replaced `innerHTML` assignments with safe DOM APIs (`createTextNode`/`createElement`) in `dialog.js` and `options.js`, resolving two "Unsafe assignment to innerHTML" warnings from the Thunderbird add-on validator

## 0.5.0

### Fixes

- **UTF-8 decoding**: raw emails from `getRaw()` are now properly decoded as UTF-8 before uploading to Odoo, fixing scrambled non-ASCII characters (e.g. `Ã¼` instead of `ü`) (#2)

### Changes

- The plugin is now able for query Odoo about emails, show information and propose matching actions.
- **Optional host permissions**: replaced the broad `<all_urls>` install-time permission with `optional_permissions` (`*://*/*`); the user is now explicitly prompted for consent when clicking _Test connection_ in the options page (per AMO review)

### Features

- **Connection test info**: a successful _Test connection_ now shows the authenticated user's login (in monospace) with display name in braces, e.g. `Connection successful as admin (Mitchell Admin)`

## 0.3.0

- Initial release
